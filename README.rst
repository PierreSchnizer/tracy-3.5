Self-Consistent Symplectic Integrator for Charged Particle Beam Dynamics
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The symplectic integrator for realistic modeling of magnetic lattices for
ring-based synchrotrons was initially implemented in Pascal as a *beam dynamics library*,
by the author, 1990; with care taken for the software architecture & resulting records/modules
– akin to *objects* although not explicitly supported by the grammar –  to reflect the structure of the mathematical objects describing
the underlying *beam dynamics model*.

The resulting C code, see below, has now been re-factored by introducing a C++ "*beam line class*";
i.e., to recover the transparency & simplicity of the original *beam dynamics model*.

Nota Bene: Although the *beam dynamics model* had to be replaced & the model/code re-architectured & structured – for a reusable approach – as a *Pascal beam dynamics libary*, the code was named Tracy-2, i.e., after the demo/prototype Tracy::

for which the *beam dynamics model* was based on the linearized quadratic Hamiltonian::



for linear optics design. In particular, because the prototype was implemented by extending the *standard procedures & functions* for the *Pascal-S compiler/interpreter* by N. Wirth::

Requirements
------------
* (GNU compatible) C/C++ compiler
* GNU autoconf/automake environment and libtool.
* GNU Scientific Library (GSL): https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl.
* Armadillo (for linear algebra): http://arma.sourceforge.net.
* Python https://www.python.org/ for the python interface

The library uses the range checking inmplementation of e.g. `std::vector` as
provided by GNU C++; thus its dependency on the GNU compiler collections.

To install
----------

Setup of repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dowload the repository and checkout the proper branch. Here it's assumed you
will use the directoy `git_repos/tracy-3.5` in your home directory for the
tracy code tree.

For this use the following commands to create the directoy `git_repos`
and to clone the tree into the tracy-3.5 directory.

.. code:: shell

   mkdir git_repos
   cd git_repos
   git clone git@github.com:jbengtsson/tracy-3.5.git
   cd tracy-3.5

Then select the proper tree by

.. code:: shell

   git checkout tracy-3.5_scsi



C++ library
~~~~~~~~~~~


First create environment variable $TRACY_LIB. This will be the prefix where the
built library and include files will be installed later on e.g:

.. code:: shell

   export TRACY_LIB=$HOME/git_repos/tracy-3.5


To build the library use:

.. code:: shell

   cd tracy-3.5
   libtoolize
   ./bootstrap
   ./configure --prefix=$TRACY_LIB
   make
   make install

Please note: using the dynamic library in non standard location will require
proper set up of the environment later on (e.g. adding the directory where the
library is located to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable).


Python interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The python interface is based on https://github.com/pybind/pybind11. Building this interface
requires to select the proper directory

.. code:: shell

  cd git_repos
  cd tracy-3.5/python

Install proper dependencies

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


And build the extension e.g.

.. code:: shell

    python3 setup.py build
    python3 setup.py install

For further details of the build system see https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/


To run the regression tests
---------------------------

All regression tests can be run using

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install nose
    python3 setup.py nosetests

To run the demo/test program
----------------------------


.. code:: shell

    python3 examples/tst.py
